## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to use Tailwind CSS in React. I also learned how to use the different array methods like `filter`, `map`, `every`, and `includes`.

- `filter` - The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

- `map` - The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

- `every` - The `every()` method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

- `includes` - The `includes()` method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.
